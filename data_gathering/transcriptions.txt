sentence_00002.mp3: the focus of our show is a little bit different today as you know we usually discuss a plethora and I know you didn't know I had that large of a vocabulary a plethora of sports Topix

sentence_00003.mp3: today we're going to be focusing on the world of bodybuilding and of athletic body training and to do that we have a former Mr America and Mr Universe

sentence_00004.mp3: Mike mentzer who is now an athletic trainer at Gold's Gym in Venice and Mike is also written three books on bodybuilding

sentence_00005.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00006.mp3: how did you first learn about bodybuilding and how did you first know that this is what you wanted to vote to a large portion of your life

sentence_00007.mp3: well it's one of those proverbial often heard stories in bodybuilding I was at a drugstore with my mother and my local in my hometown of Ephrata Pennsylvania

sentence_00008.mp3: while she was off

sentence_00009.mp3: I was looking over the magazines and

sentence_00010.mp3: all of a sudden my attention was arrested by the side of a muscle man

sentence_00011.mp3: and I knew instantly there was no lag time this is what I was going to be and

sentence_00012.mp3: it was a love affair and I've been doing it ever since

sentence_00013.mp3: I'll be

sentence_00014.mp3: what role do you think Jeannette

sentence_00015.mp3: plays in the sport of bodybuild

sentence_00016.mp3: it's very important it's hard to determine exactly how important

sentence_00017.mp3: along with motivation

sentence_00018.mp3: and the discipline involved of course I would say

sentence_00019.mp3: so you're saying

sentence_00020.mp3: there are certain people who were born with certain body types of certain muscle length that they can't correct for yeah I think most sports

sentence_00021.mp3: tend to have certain body types that Excel more than other body types for instance in basketball

sentence_00022.mp3: in bodybuilding the indices aren't quite as evident but things like you mentioned muscle belly

sentence_00023.mp3: bone

sentence_00024.mp3: an inherited predisposition towards building muscle mass

sentence_00025.mp3: and that's something you can't determine until you actually begin training

sentence_00026.mp3: some people when they start training

sentence_00027.mp3: grow almost immediately then there are other people who trained for years and years

sentence_00028.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00029.mp3: something that I was curious about because you know there's so many different theories about training and

sentence_00030.mp3: I hear people say well

sentence_00031.mp3: you can eat anything you want as long as you're working out constantly and I've never

sentence_00032.mp3: held that to be true how important is Diet when one is training is there is there a percentage where you should devote to exercise for you know I think they're both 100% important years ago there was a saying that diet is 80% of bodybuilding

sentence_00033.mp3: but I don't think you can quantify it that way you got to train properly and you got to eat properly

sentence_00034.mp3: I think diet is important because one of the first requisites in being a great athlete is that you're healthy

sentence_00035.mp3: and you got to eat a well-balanced diet to be health

sentence_00036.mp3: I don't think it's any more important than that

sentence_00037.mp3: many athletes tend to overemphasize certain elements of diet like vitamins and protein

sentence_00038.mp3: is that you need a well-balanced diet just so that you're healthy

sentence_00039.mp3: carbohydrates to protein to Fat well if you were to listen to the hucksters of the nutritional products you would believe that your diet should be made up entirely of

sentence_00040.mp3: but if you listen to

sentence_00041.mp3: qualified nutritional scientist

sentence_00042.mp3: carbohydrates 25% protein and

sentence_00049.mp3: and a lot of these athletes men and women come from different sports do you consider bodybuilders

sentence_00050.mp3: the sport more of a disc

sentence_00051.mp3: I think all sports involve discipline

sentence_00052.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00053.mp3: it depends upon how you define sport the fact that you have all these men around the world engaged

sentence_00054.mp3: serious physical training which will eventually culminate

sentence_00055.mp3: in the pursuit of a competitive goal I think it's a sport

sentence_00056.mp3: I'm talking about your career today as an athletic trainer are you are you enjoying sharing your knowledge that you've attained over the years and sharing with other people and helping them

sentence_00057.mp3: build their bodies is it giving you a lot of personal satisfaction

sentence_00058.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00059.mp3: as you may know yourself athletic training has to be a little old as you get older yourself

sentence_00064.mp3: Mike I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who would like to improve their physiques and their bodies and

sentence_00065.mp3: would want to go to perhaps a trainer but what what should somebody look at

sentence_00066.mp3: when they are looking into getting a trainer what are some of the qualifications maybe muscular development or even his athletic appearance

sentence_00067.mp3: presumably the person's going to the gym because he knows little or nothing about training

sentence_00068.mp3: I think the only

sentence_00069.mp3: general intelligence level

sentence_00070.mp3: and listen as to how well he explains the principles of productive exercise

sentence_00071.mp3: how's the weather now he has a grasp of the principles of

sentence_00072.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00073.mp3: get more muscle mass or they want to become defined

sentence_00074.mp3: talk about it a little bit about the different theories between gaining mass what you should do and maybe if somebody just wants to remain lean and not really gain

sentence_00075.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00076.mp3: good point as a matter of fact there are two types of basic training

sentence_00077.mp3: you can train either for muscle mass or endurance which tends to burn body fat and keep you

sentence_00078.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00079.mp3: for those who want to build muscle mass the most important principle is that of in

sentence_00080.mp3: the heart of your training the more weight you

sentence_00081.mp3: the more you put into it

sentence_00082.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00083.mp3: and those who are looking to just remain lean and not develop muscle perhaps tone themselves

sentence_00084.mp3: the intensity factor the amount of weight they lift is not so important

sentence_00085.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00086.mp3: there's been a lot of talk for years and years and years and not only in bodybuilding but several Sports about

sentence_00087.mp3: the use of steroids

sentence_00088.mp3: how prevalent are they today compared to when you were competing

sentence_00089.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00090.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00091.mp3: there's a movement away from steroid use since the increase media attention

sentence_00092.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00093.mp3: towards the the deleterious effects of steroid

sentence_00094.mp3: but in those who are still competing I think there's an even greater

sentence_00095.mp3: play some stir

sentence_00096.mp3: for those who are hell-bent on competing

sentence_00097.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00098.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00099.mp3: which is not a steroid compound in itself but does affect

sentence_00114.mp3: who have Healthy Families

sentence_00115.mp3: do you feel they are necessary to compete on an international level

sentence_00116.mp3: Mr Olympia the Lee Haynes of the world without a doubt not saying that he does because I don't know if he does or does not but I'm staying on that level

sentence_00117.mp3: yeah if you want to compete on even the local national International or professional level without a doubt steroids are a part of it can you define for audience what is a steroid

sentence_00118.mp3: is it supposed

sentence_00119.mp3: well in the General Media and in the bodybuilding media also there have been reports about bodybuilders who have

sentence_00120.mp3: started fire

sentence_00121.mp3: decimated hole bar rooms full of men because they on steroids

sentence_00133.mp3: to seeing a

sentence_00145.mp3: there isn't much being done in the way of research towards increased training or improved Training Method

sentence_00146.mp3: or improved nutritional or dietary

sentence_00147.mp3: and in part because of the public outcry against steroids I don't think there's a whole lot of research being

sentence_00148.mp3: done in the area of steroids either

sentence_00149.mp3: I don't think

sentence_00150.mp3: you're going to see much improvement in the standard over the next few years in body

sentence_00151.mp3: I don't think people should get the idea that they can just take steroids and they're going to develop into

sentence_00152.mp3: is Greek god

sentence_00153.mp3: you still got to train and buy it intensely it's been proven that those who take steroids and do not train do not get any results either

sentence_00161.mp3: Spanish the reason there's going to be somebody out there who does that

sentence_00162.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00163.mp3: but it should be born out too that there is a health risk and

sentence_00164.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00165.mp3: is it illegal to take steroids doctors can still prescribe them but

sentence_00166.mp3: now the prescription is require a triplicate

sentence_00167.mp3: the government controls

sentence_00177.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00178.mp3: you mentioned also along the same lines

sentence_00179.mp3: I guess growth hormone including myself

sentence_00180.mp3: would that give you size and what what effect would a steroid give you is it more energy or what's the purpose

sentence_00181.mp3: steroids or

sentence_00182.mp3: the difference between the two I guess is what I'm saying

sentence_00183.mp3: well I can't

sentence_00184.mp3: personal experience when I was competing years ago I did take steroids and never took growth hormone

sentence_00185.mp3: from what I understand the the

sentence_00186.mp3: reaction is a little bit different with the growth

sentence_00194.mp3: I'm curious when you were when you were competing

sentence_00195.mp3: did you ever

sentence_00196.mp3: because a lot of people don't like the appearance of bodybuilders they think it's kind of grotesque did you was that hard for you to deal with people saying to you you look like you're you're too big no no as a matter of fact I was always a bit of a rebel throughout my life and

sentence_00197.mp3: the thought that I would be different from other people never bothered me when I heard that it bother other people and even gave me more impetus to continue train

sentence_00198.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00199.mp3: is there a negative comments come from jealousy because I think the dedication of the requires to look like when you're competing

sentence_00200.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00201.mp3: yeah as a matter of fact I've talked to many people in the past

sentence_00202.mp3: claimed initially they didn't like the look of a bodybuilder

sentence_00203.mp3: contest and show him the magazine over a period of time their standards

sentence_00204.mp3: we've got a picture of Mike on the monitor here also excuse me Mike

sentence_00217.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00218.mp3: haha and the body doesn't necessarily work that way if 2 hours or 4 hours a day we're good why not train 12 hours a day

sentence_00219.mp3: training is a form of stress

sentence_00220.mp3: and up to a certain point in time

sentence_00221.mp3: exposing the body

sentence_00222.mp3: is distress can be beneficial

sentence_00223.mp3: but beyond a definite period of time it can actually be detrimental

sentence_00224.mp3: let me ask you

sentence_00225.mp3: the top

sentence_00226.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00227.mp3: the vast majority of people who train

sentence_00228.mp3: train it almost exactly the same way for 2 to 4 hours a day 6 to 7 days a week

sentence_00230.mp3: and tend to be reasonable individuals

sentence_00241.mp3: pulse

sentence_00242.mp3: you will develop a cardiovascular training affect and improve your heart and lungs along with your skeletal muscle Tiss

sentence_00243.mp3: give us a sample diet of someone that wanted to

sentence_00244.mp3: lose weight I mean how many calories I guess it really depends on the individual person you can make an overall

sentence_00245.mp3: Could not understand audio

sentence_00246.mp3: as long as the individual goes below his or her maintenance level of calories

sentence_00247.mp3: they will lose

sentence_00248.mp3: weather whether their maintenance level is 1500 calories a day or 15

sentence_00249.mp3: any number below that will cause the body to revert to fat burning instead of

sentence_00250.mp3: storing

sentence_00258.mp3: as long as you're taking care of yourself training

sentence_00259.mp3: two or three times a week

sentence_00266.mp3: but it is true that men gain weight in areas that the women don't gain weight

sentence_00280.mp3: over a period of time

sentence_00281.mp3: within two or three years if you haven't gained anything at all either you're training in properly which is often the case

sentence_00282.mp3: or you have poor Jeanette

sentence_00292.mp3: testing competitors

sentence_00293.mp3: but it's obvious to those who are in the know who have the eye for these things that they're still taking it so they

sentence_00294.mp3: have somehow found a way to

sentence_00295.mp3: what's the test

sentence_00296.mp3: so you don't sound like you're saying there's a certain look

sentence_00297.mp3: Could not understand audio
